We will be dealing with the Heart disease dataset and will analyze, and predict whether the patient has heart disease or is normal.
This prediction will make it faster and more efficient in healthcare sectors which will be a time-consuming process.

8. Maximum heart rate achieved

9. Exercise induced angina

10. Oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest

11. The slope of the peak exercise ST segment

12. Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
